This issue doesn't have a perfect solution within the Expo ecosystem, as it's a limitation of the underlying Android browser handling.  There is no reliable method to force-close an external browser instance from within a React Native app.  Workarounds often involve creating a custom browser component or using a different browser.  Custom implementations would significantly increase complexity and require handling Android-specific interactions.
